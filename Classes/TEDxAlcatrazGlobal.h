// A way to remove the debugging to the console from the app when not in debug build, making the app
// smaller and faster. It also adds the extra logging I have been meaning to drop in for ages which is 
// logging the function and line too. We could also add __FILE__ but we probably don't need it. 
// From http://iphoneincubator.com/blog/tag/nslog
// DLog is almost a drop-in replacement for DLog  
// DLog();
// DLog(@"here");  
// DLog(@"value: %d", x);  
// Unfortunately this doesn't work DLog(aStringVariable); you have to do this instead DLog(@"%@", aStringVariable);
